### Linear Search vs Binary Search

#### Linear Search
Linear search is a straightforward algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached. The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means that in the worst case, the algorithm will have to examine every element in the list.

Advantages:
- Simple to implement.
- Works on unsorted lists.

Disadvantages:
- Inefficient for large datasets as it has a linear time complexity.
- Every element must be checked, leading to potentially long search times.

#### Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that divides the search interval in half each time. It requires the list to be sorted. The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means that the number of comparisons needed to find the target element is significantly reduced.

Advantages:
- Much faster than linear search for large datasets due to logarithmic time complexity.
- Fewer comparisons needed, making it more efficient.

Disadvantages:
- Requires the list to be sorted.
- More complex to implement compared to linear search.

#### Which Performs Faster?
Binary search performs faster than linear search, especially for large datasets. The logarithmic time complexity of binary search means that the number of comparisons needed grows very slowly as the size of the list increases. For example, for a list of 1,000,000 elements, binary search would require at most about 20 comparisons, whereas linear search might require up to 1,000,000 comparisons in the worst case.

Therefore, when dealing with large, sorted datasets, binary search is the preferred method due to its efficiency and significantly faster performance compared to linear search.
