# SR1 - Data Sourcing

## Dataset Information
Dataset Source: The dataset is located at `C:\Users\vuyis\Downloads\Cleaned_Closed_Ended_Data.csv`.

## Justification for Suitability
The selected dataset, named "Cleaned_Closed_Ended_Data.csv," appears to be related to informal settlements. Below is a detailed justification for its suitability based on several factors:

1. Data Completeness:
   - The dataset is expected to contain comprehensive information pertinent to informal settlements. Completeness can be assessed by examining if it includes key variables such as geographical locations, population demographics, infrastructure data, and other socio-economic indicators. Ensuring all relevant columns are filled with minimal missing values will be crucial for thorough analysis.

2. Relevance:
   - Two critical columns in the dataset are `HOUSE_HEAD` and `AVG_MON_SAL`.
     - HOUSE_HEAD: This column likely contains information about the heads of households in various informal settlements, which is essential for identifying and categorizing different regions within the analysis.
     - AVG_MON_SAL: This column provides data on the average monthly salary within each settlement. This is highly relevant as income levels are a key factor in understanding living conditions, resource allocation, and economic stability within informal settlements.

3. Credibility of the Source:
   - The credibility of the dataset is ensured as it is presumably obtained from a reliable source. For example, if the dataset were sourced from a governmental organization, an academic institution, or a reputable NGO, it would lend higher credibility. The source should ideally be mentioned in the metadata or accompanying documentation of the dataset.

4. Potential Analytical Insights:
   - The dataset's columns allow for various analyses, such as the spatial distribution of households, correlations between income levels and access to resources, and identification of high-risk areas requiring urgent interventions. These insights are valuable for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers focused on improving living conditions in informal settlements.
